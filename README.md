# Pong in C

A simple pong game recreated using the **Raylib** library and the **C** programming language.

## Building from source
```
cmake -Bbuild -S.
cmake --build build
```

Then run the executable in the `build` folder.

## Controls
**W/A** keys to control the left paddle and **Left/Right** arrow keys to control the right one.

## Things to be completed
Even though the game is at a playable state, there are couple of things yet to be implemented:
- Enemy AI
- Help screen
- Settings screen
